//java program to generate random number
//You can compile these codes on an online java compilers(https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/online-compiler/)
//To compile these codes on an independent compiler you can make the main class as public (eg:public class Random{ )

class Random {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = (int)(Math.random() * 10000001); //this line pick's a random number and stores it in the integger variable "num"
        System.out.println( num ); //the random number stored in "num" is printed 
 
    }
